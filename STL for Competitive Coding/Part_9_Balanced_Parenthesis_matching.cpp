You can see that in the above example every opening parenthesis has it's 
closing parenthesis also. i.e first bracket has it's closing bracket also 
similarly second and third brackets also has their closing one.
So, this is called parenthesis matching.


But, in the below example you can see that second parenthesis donot has it's closing one.

/*
We have to insert the opening parenthesis in the stack till we get the closing parenthesis.
And when we get the closing one then check it's opening parenthesis. If it is present
in the stack then pop it otherwise it is a sign of unbalanced parenthesis.

We will traverse the whole string i.e (())() and after traversing the whole string
stack should be empty. If the stack is empty at the end then the Balanced parenthesis
otherwise unbalanced parenthesis.

------------------------------ Hackerrank Problem ----------------------------------------

A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: (, ), {, }, [, or ].

Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket (i.e., (, [, or {) occurs to the left of a closing bracket (i.e., ), ], or }) of the exact same type. There are three types of matched pairs of brackets: [], {}, and ().

A matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses are not matched. For example, {[(])} is not balanced because the contents in between { and } are not balanced. The pair of square brackets encloses a single, unbalanced opening bracket, (, and the pair of parentheses encloses a single, unbalanced closing square bracket, ].

By this logic, we say a sequence of brackets is balanced if the following conditions are met:

* It contains no unmatched brackets.
* The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of brackets is also a matched pair of brackets.

Given n strings of brackets, determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced. If a string is balanced, return YES. Otherwise, return NO.

Function Description :

Complete the function isBalanced in the editor below.

isBalanced has the following parameter(s):

* string s: a string of brackets

Returns
* string: either YES or NO

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer n, the number of strings.
Each of the next n lines contains a single string s, a sequence of brackets.

Constraints

* 1<=n<=10^3
* 1<=|s|<=10^3 , where  is the length of the sequence.
*All chracters in the sequences âˆˆ { {, }, (, ), [, ] }.

Output Format

For each string, return YES or NO.

Sample Input

STDIN           Function
-----           --------
3               n = 3
{[()]}          first s = '{[()]}'
{[(])}          second s = '{[(])}'
{{[[(())]]}}    third s ='{{[[(())]]}}'

Sample Output

YES
NO
YES

Explanation

1. The string {[()]} meets both criteria for being a balanced string.
2. The string {[(])} is not balanced because the brackets enclosed by the matched pair { and } are not balanced: [(]).
3. The string {{[[(())]]}} meets both criteria for being a balanced string.
